            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is a duty to meet together in the way of God as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers of him, and it is a danger to be negligent in that Reſpect, therefore let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, and let us conſider one another, to provoke unto Love, and to good works, not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching, for if we ſin wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after we have received the knowledge of the truth, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearfull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries. <hi>Heb</hi> 10.23, 24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>It was the manner of ſome in the Primative Time to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in aſſembling and meeting together with the people of God, under the Goſpel diſpenſation, and when they did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect that duty either out of prejudice againſt them that continued faithfull in a Godly exerciſe, or to flee the Croſs ſo as to grow ſecure and careleſs, or elſe to avoid a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering condition, It was accounted all one with the ſin of preſumption, by ſinning not ignorantly but wilfully, and that after they had received the knowledge of the Truth, and as it was dangerous, ſo to do then, it is as unſafe and dangerous to ſollow the like example, and be ſo negligent now.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome may think, it will be the way to avoid a great danger, and be for their ſaftey now to neglect aſſembling and meeting with the people of God, in a way differing from the worſhip of the world, to the number of five or above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are prohibited by the Law of the Land under great penalties to meet upon the account of Religion, and worſhip of God, as aforeſaid Contrary to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> or practiſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>DEar Friends, Brethren, and Siſters, whom I dearly love in the Lord, my dear love runs forth unto you, hath an entrance within you, and doth reſt upon you. It is a precious thing to feel the Lord poſſeſſing our hearts and ſpirits, living, ruling, and reigning within us, and to feel one another in the power of an endleſſe life, which is for our refreſhment, and great conſolation, they who are under the daily adminiſtration of the ſpirit and power of God, do daily partake of the love, vertue and ſweetneſſe of God; for the power bindeth under or removes all obſtructions, oppoſitions, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and beſetments of ſoul, and reacheth unto it for its relief and refreſhment, and carrieth forth unto it of the eternal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31939:8"/>ſweetneſſe, that it feeds at the breaſt, and is nouriſhed with the milk of the Word, which is the vertue of God, and taſtes of its ſweetneſſe: ſo that it can ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Thy word is ſweeter unto my taſte then the honey, and the honey-comb.</hi> The Lord hath come forth in power unto us, and we are witneſſes thereof: ſo hath he come forth in vertue and ſweetneſſe within us, and our ſoules have taſted thereof, he hath been with us in ſtroms and tempeſts, ſo that the flouds of afflictions and waters of perſecutions hath not deſtroyed us, we have been kept in the Ark of the Covenant above the waters, and carried over to the dry land of peace and reſt by the arm of the Lord, he hath ſtood between us and the dangers, and hath kept back the force of the ſtorms, and violence of the enemy from us, ſo that though he hath often tried us, yet he did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſtroy us, but had a way in his wiſdome to keep and preſerve us, and though troubles and afflictions attend us, yet the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing preſence is with us, and his free ſpirit doth uphold us. We have this teſtimony that we are a people bleſſed and beloved of God; and though our troubles have heretofore been many, yet our deliverances have been as many, for many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth out of them all. And as we have had many deliverances wrought and brought to paſſe for us by the arm and power of the Lord, ſo we have had many teſtimonies of his love and refreſhings from his preſence brought home upon our hearts, and reached into our ſpirits; and therefore we have had many encouragements from him to continue and abide with the Lord when ever we are afflicted and tried.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath given his Word unto us, and we have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Lord, that he will never fail us nor forſake us. And therefore have we cauſe to believe in his Word; for though we are brought forth into a trying time, yet it is the Lords own doing, and he who hath begotten us to himſelf through the Son of his love into a Covenant of Grace, and brought us forth to appear for him in that principle and ſpirit of Jeſus, wherein we and our ſervices are acceptable and well pleaſing to the Lord, though oppoſed and hated by the principle and ſpirit of the world, he knows how to keep and preſerve us to his own praiſe.</p>
            <p>For the Lord hath appeared unto us, and joyned himſelf with us in a ſpiritual way, and after a ſpiritual manner; and he hath ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31939:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>by his good ſpirit that we are his people, and he is our God, and we have this teſtimony that we and our ſervices are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and well pleaſing unto him: and therefore we have good cauſe to continue and abide with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Dear friends, be at peace amongſt your ſelves, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, give way to nothing that would obſtruct or hinder it, and let the word of Chriſt dwell plentifully in you. Be diligent and faithful to the Lord, for he hath been and is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto you, you have no juſt cauſe of complaint againſt him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him have no juſt cauſe of complaint againſt you. And for as much as he hath choſen you, and manifeſted his love unto you, and joyned himſelf with you, deal not unworthily with him, ſo as to forſake him: break no Covenant with him, neither do you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate your ſelves from him again, but be true and faithfull unto the Lord, and continue with him, notwithſtanding all tribulations and afflictions that doth or may attend you in a trying time, and under a ſuffering condition.</p>
            <p>Be tender and loving one to another, as the Lord hath been and is tender and loving to you, do not uncover one anothers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the world, nor to ſuch as do or may ſeek an occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them and the truth, for the Lord hath not dealt ſo with you; therefore do unto others as the Lord hath done unto you, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes appear for the Lord in the principle and ſpirit of God that you may reach unto, and be anſwered again by the witneſſe of God.</p>
            <p>Take heed of judging any appearance of God in one another, but cheriſh every good thing, and judge this rather, that you lay not a ſtumbling block in anothers way to offend the weak, or cauſe them to fall, &amp; turn aſide from the truth and way of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And be diligent and faithful in meeting together in the way of the Lord, as worſhippers of him, and do not forſake the aſſembling of your ſelves together for fear of an outward ſuffering from men; for it is your duty to aſſemble and meet together in the fear of the Lord, and it is a danger to be negligent in that reſpect, if men command you to neglect the aſſembling of your ſelves together in the way of the Lord, as worſhippers of him, in ſuch a caſe it is better to obey God rather then man; for if you for your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faithfulneſſe to God in aſſembling and meeting together in the way of his worſhip (wherein he hath enjoyned you to walk)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31939:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>do fall into the hands of men, and be liable to ſuffer by them for ſo doing, the Lord knows both how to ſupport you under the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and can alſo deliver you from them, but if you do forſake the way of the Lord wherein he hath appeared unto you, and wherein he hath for many years owned you, and given you many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his love and acceptation, and fall into the hand and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God for ſo doing, no King nor Potentate upon earth can deliver you therefrom. Therefore it is better and more ſafe to obey the Lord, and fall into the hands and diſpleaſure of men for the ſame, then to diſobey the Lord, to obey the will of man and fall under the diſpleaſure of God for ſo doing, becauſe that no man can deliver you from the wrath of the Lord, but the Lord can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from the wrath and diſpleaſure of man, and cauſe one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be glad under a ſuffering condition, for tribulation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth patience, and patience experience, and experience hope which makes not aſhamed.</p>
            <p>You know what the Lord hath been unto you in former trialls, and how he hath taken all ſlaviſh fears and faintneſſe of heart from you, and hath letten forth his power and virtue within you, and put boldneſſe and courage upon you, ſo that you have been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the power of heaven, and made to rejoyce and triumph under a ſuffering condition, when you have ſuffered for the Lord and his truth; ſo that he hath both armed and prepared you for himſelf, that you may give up into his will to be ordered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by him, for ye are not your own, but are bought with a price. Therefore glorifie God in your bodies, ſouls, and ſpirits, which are the Lords, that you may be the people of his praiſe.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath a right to diſpoſe of you both by creation and by redemption, and hath delivered your ſouls from under the power of the enemy, who ſought your deſtruction, and hath prevented him, and preſerved you unto this day, and alſo been with you in many dangers, and ſtood betwixt you and the danger, and delivered you therefrom, and kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
